# British-Airways-Customer-Review-Analysis
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities. At first I prepared a dataset from collecting customer reviews from the website 'Skytrax' and cleaned the data so it can be prepared for drawing valuable insights. Later on conducted text mining and sentiment analysis and posted all the valuable points on power point presentation slide.
